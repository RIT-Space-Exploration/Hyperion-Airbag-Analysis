# IREC-Airbag-Analysis
Analyzes the motion of an airbag during impact from freefall. 
This script presents the solution to a linear second-order ordinary differential equation for the motion of a mass on a spring. This
will be used to model the deformation of an airbag, to be used in the Hyperion mission. The simulation focuses on the initial impact, it does
not go through the "bounces" that would occur in reality. The reason being the initial impact is the greatest in impulse and will be the determining
factor of the material selection and geometry.
